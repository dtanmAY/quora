(4, 'The Babies at the Fringes of Fertility Tech', '<p>Ryley&rsquo;s clinic,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bostonivf.com/our-practice/success-rates/\" target=\"_blank\">Boston IVF</a>, has been a leading fertility center for more than 30 years. The clinic claims to have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bostonivf.com/our-practice/why-we-are-different/\" target=\"_blank\">the first in New England</a>&nbsp;to help a lesbian couple get pregnant; in 1998, it was the first clinic to help a gay male couple have a baby via surrogate. The clinic also achieved a number of other firsts, including the first donor egg pregnancy in New England and the first birth in Massachusetts to result from a frozen egg back in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I was in residency back in the &rsquo;80s, you&rsquo;d be lucky if you had a live birth rate of 10 percent,&rdquo; Ryley says. As for the more out-there techniques underway, he adds, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like a typical American, but in my opinion, more well-controlled, well-regulated research needs to be done. But is it exciting, especially for these people who suffer from these terrible disorders? Absolutely it&rsquo;s exciting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, barriers exist. Another form of mitochondrial replacement, known as cytoplasmic transfer (CT), was banned by the FDA in 2001 because of a worry that it may lead to chromosomal abnormalities, which could result in birth defects.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For infertile couples or women who have endured multiple miscarriages, MRT represents another chance at having a child to whom they&rsquo;re genetically related.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other reasons frontier fertility research doesn&rsquo;t happen much stateside. The first is known as the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, an appropriations rider that bans federal funding for research that involves destroying embryos (which happens in nearly all embryo-related research). The amendment is included in the annual federal budget and has been renewed every year since 1996. Bioconservatives, pro-lifers, and many prominent American bioethicists continue to stand by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/dickey-wicker-amendment-1996\" target=\"_blank\">Dickey-Wicker Amendment</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, another congressional rider was added to the budget that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-congress-moves-to-block-human-embryo-editing/\" target=\"_blank\">prohibits the FDA from even accepting research applications</a>&nbsp;for embryo research that would include editing the human germline, a move Stanford bioethicist Hank Greely called &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; at the time. It is similarly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ComplianceActivities/Enforcement/UntitledLetters/UCM570225.pdf?source=govdelivery&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\" target=\"_blank\">illegal to create a genetically modified embryo</a>, which the FDA considers MRT embryos to be. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2018/07/25173131/PS_2018.07.26_gene-editing_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">public opinion</a>&nbsp;on the topic is shifting, with the majority of U.S. adults saying they think gene editing that treats serious congenital diseases is appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK has seen its own political brouhaha around MRT, but the results have been different. In 2015, Parliament gave the green light to begin the process of setting up a regulatory framework for clinics to provide MRT for couples with mitochondrial disease, a model that has been adopted in Australia and Singapore. As a result, legal, regulated three-person British babies are expected to be born anytime now.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>MRT and techniques like it are the result of progress in other areas of fertility research&mdash;namely, what goes wrong, and when, in the development of a fetus. Mitochondrial diseases, which can vary in severity, are among the most lethal genetic diseases, because they are rare and there are no cures. They are also passed along the matrilineal line, through mitochondrial DNA. In the United States, fewer than 4,000 babies are born every year with mitochondrial diseases; the other fetuses simply don&rsquo;t make it that far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For infertile couples or women who have endured multiple miscarriages, MRT represents another chance at having a child to whom they&rsquo;re genetically related.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;A deputy [in the government] asked me if anyone has confirmed MRT is safe for the baby. I said, &lsquo;Nobody has confirmed it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There are at least three ways to split an ovum, or human egg, to separate the mitochondria from the nucleus. Zhang used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mitochondrialtransfer.wordpress.com/the-logistics/mitochondrial-replacement/maternal-spindle-transfer/\" target=\"_blank\">maternal spindle transfer</a>&nbsp;for the baby born in Mexico, while Zukin specializes in something called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08958\" target=\"_blank\">pronuclear transfer</a>. Both techniques are legal in the UK for experimental treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zukin&rsquo;s particular arrangement in Ukraine is cloudier. There are no explicit laws permitting the procedures, so he&rsquo;s operating under a kind of gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement with the Ukrainian government rather than an official regulatory pass. &ldquo;We received special permission for clinical trials,&rdquo; Zukin says. &ldquo;A deputy [in the government] asked me if anyone has confirmed MRT is safe for the baby. I said, &lsquo;Nobody has confirmed it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zukin says the data from his clinical experiments will provide the basis for the parliamentary decision on whether it will officially sanction or prohibit MRT. &ldquo;If we have any confirmation that [MRT] is risky for babies&rsquo; health, it will be prohibited. If it is safe for the babies, and the babies are healthy, we will allow it,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n', '2018-08-03 20:54:34', 'images/panda.jpg'),
(5, 'A New Device Can Hear Your Thoughts', '<p>early April, MIT research assistant Arnav Kapur, 24, uploaded a short&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuUSc53Xpeg\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>&nbsp;on YouTube. The clip showed him moving around campus in various settings wearing a white plastic contraption wrapped around the right side of his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he walked by rows of bikes parked next to mounds of melting snow, his lips were closed while his inner thoughts flashed as words on the screen. &ldquo;Time?&rdquo; it read. A male voice responded, &ldquo;10:35 a.m.&rdquo; In the next scene, Kapur was shopping in a bodega. The prices of the things he tossed into his shopping cartâ€Š&mdash;â€Štoilet paper, an Italian wrap, canned peachesâ€Š&mdash;â€Šappeared on the screen. &ldquo;Total $10.07,&rdquo; the male voice responded. In the final scene, Kapur moved a cursor around a video console, ostensibly with his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur came to MIT&rsquo;s Media Lab from New Delhi in 2016 to build wearable devices that seamlessly integrate technology into our 24/7 experience. No more reaching for cellphones. No more staring at screens. No more eyes down. No more tuning out to plug in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improbably,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>AlterEgo, the soundless, voiceless, earbud-less device he&rsquo;d been working on for the last two years had become adept enough at reading his thoughts that he could use it to order an Uber without saying a word.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;We wanted to capture interactions that are as close to thinking in your head as possible.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In its current incarnation, Kapur&rsquo;s deviceâ€Š&mdash;â€Šdeveloped in collaboration with his brother Shreyas (an MIT undergrad), a few fellow grad students in the Fluid Interfaces department, and lead A.I. guru Professor Pattie Maesâ€Š&mdash;â€Šis a 3D-printed wearable device outfitted with electromagnetic sensors that hugs one side of your jaw and, via Bluetooth, connects you with your what Maes calls your computer brainâ€Š&mdash;â€Šthe Internet&rsquo;s massive web of information most of us access via smartphones some 80 times a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s radical for the simple reason that it is noninvasiveâ€Š&mdash;â€Šno implants requiredâ€Š&mdash;â€Šand can process silent human communication with an exceptionally high degree of accuracy. Eventually, Kapur promises, this contraption will be practically invisible to other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Afew months after the video came out, Kapur sat down for an interview with Medium in a small fifth-floor Media Lab office, which he shares with other researchers. He&rsquo;s clean-shaven, neatly dressed, and grad-student thin; his brown eyes alternating between sleepy and searingly intenseâ€Š&mdash;â€Šan impressive trick. Among the computer parts, books, and other detritus scattered around the room sits a pink ukulele. Not his, he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur&rsquo;s natural inclination is to talk long, but since his invention has been drawing media attention, he&rsquo;s clearly been working on his soundbites. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very passionate about A.I.,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I think the future of human society is about us collaborating with machines.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the introduction of the smartphone, 2.5 billion people already turn to their computer brain when they need to drive somewhere or cook something or communicate with other humans or forget the capital of Missouri. Cognitive augmentation through technology has become central to daily life. Organic brain, computer brain. They&rsquo;re already working together, says Kapur, just not as well as they could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the way our devices are designed, however, they distract us more than help us. To consult with the infinite world at our fingertips, we have to give our devices our full attention. Screens demand eye contact. Phones require earbuds. They pull us out of the physical world and into theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur wants to perfect a device that allows users to communicate with A.I. as effortlessly as one&rsquo;s left brain talks to one&rsquo;s right brain, so that humans can integrate the power of the Internet into their thinking at every level. Once the technology becomes a natural extension of the body, Kapur believes, we will be free to become better at being human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is how we&rsquo;re going to live our lives,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When conceptualizing AlterEgo, Kapur based his design guidelines on a few fixed principles. The device couldn&rsquo;t be invasive because he considers that inconvenient and not scalable. Interacting with it had to feel natural as well as be invisible to others, so the device had to be able to pick up silent cues. Painfully aware of the ways tech can get co-opted, he also wanted user-control baked into the design so that the device would only detect&nbsp;<em>volitional</em>, rather than subconscious, signals. In other words, it should only read your thoughts when you want it to.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>You must&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to communicate with your computer brain in order to interact with&nbsp;it.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Other tech pioneers have developed human-to-computer conversational interfaces with some success, but there are always caveats. To interact with Siri and Alexa, one must talk directly to a machine, which feels unnatural and isn&rsquo;t private. Hampering adoption of this technology is the creeping concern that we don&rsquo;t know exactly who&rsquo;s listening to what when these devices are around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur needed a new way around the problem. What if a computer could read our thoughts?</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Asa researcher who &ldquo;dabbles across disciplines&rdquo; (he&rsquo;s tried and failed to write a short website bio because he doesn&rsquo;t want to be &ldquo;put in a box&rdquo;), Kapur began to think of the human body not as a limitation but as a conduit. He saw the brain as the power source driving a complex electrical neural network that controls our thoughts and movements. When the brain wants to, say, move a finger, it sends an electrical impulse down the arm to the correct digit and the muscle responds accordingly. Sensors can pick up those electrical signals. One just needs to know where and how to tap in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur knew that when we read to ourselves, our inner articulatory muscles move, subconsciously forming the words we&rsquo;re seeing. &ldquo;When one speaks aloud, the brain sends electrical instructions to more than 100 muscles in your speech system,&rdquo; he explains. Internal vocalizationâ€Š&mdash;â€Šwhat we do when we read silently to ourselvesâ€Š&mdash;â€Šis a highly attenuated version of this process, wherein only the inner speech muscles are neurologically triggered. We developed this habit when we were taught to readâ€Š&mdash;â€Šsounding out letters then speaking each word aloud. It&rsquo;s a habit that&rsquo;s also a liabilityâ€Š&mdash;â€Šspeed-reading courses often focus on eliminating word formation as we scan a page of text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First observed in the mid-19th century, this neurological signalling is the only known physical expression of a mental activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur wondered whether sensors could detect the physical manifestations of this internal conversationâ€Š&mdash;â€Štiny electrical charges firing from the brainâ€Š&mdash;â€Šon the skin of the face, even if the muscles involved were located deep in the mouth and throat. Even if they weren&rsquo;t exactly moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original design of AlterEgo&rsquo;s armature pinned a grid of 30 sensors to a subject&rsquo;s face and jaw so that they could pick up the neuromuscular action when the experimenter used his or her inner voice to communicate. Proprietary software was calibrated to analyze the signals and turn them into distinct words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was just one problem: In the beginning, AlterEgo&rsquo;s sensors detected nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur had built the hardware and the software and hoped for the best. But the myoelectrical signals from this silent speech were very weak. It would have been easy to rethink the whole thing at that point. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we wanted to capture interactions as close to thinking in your head as possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur moved the sensors to different regions of the face, increased their sensitivity, and reworked the software. Still nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One night, Kapur and his brother were testing the device in their Cambridge apartment. Kapur was wearing the device and Shreyas was monitoring the computer screen. They&rsquo;d rigged the device to track signals in real time so that Shreyas could note the exact moment it picked up something, if anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was getting late. Kapur had been speaking silently into the device for a couple of hoursâ€Š&mdash;â€Šhaving programmed it to understand just two words:&nbsp;<em>yes</em>and&nbsp;<em>no</em>â€Š&mdash;â€Šwithout any meaningful results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Shreyas thought he saw something. A blip on the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Kapur says. He turned his back on his brother and repeated the action. &ldquo;We kept seeing one bump in the signal and thought it was some artifact in the wires. We were really sure this was some sort of noise in the system.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were they actually seeing something?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After testing and retesting for the next hour, Kapur was convinced that they&rsquo;d made contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That was a crazy moment,&rdquo; he says. They celebrated with a pizza the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Ittook Kapur and his collaborators two years to develop the hardware and software for AlterEgo, designing the device so that it could be worn with ease, refining its sensors and target locations to downsize the package into something less visually intrusive. Eschewing earbuds, which he believes disrupt normal human behavior, he developed an aural feedback system through bone conduction; the device whispers answers to queries like a genius guardian angel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the device started picking up myoelectrical pulses, Kapur focused on developing a data set to train AlterEgo to recognize signal signatures for various words. It was a laborious processâ€Š&mdash;â€Šsomeone had to sit in a lab wearing the device and silently speak specific words until the computer mastered them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, AlterEgo has a vocabulary of 100 words, including numbers from 1 to 9, and commands like add, subtract, reply, call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the YouTube video made it look like AlterEgo was reading Kapur&rsquo;s mind, there was some public hand-wringing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really very scary that our thoughts are no longer private,&rdquo; wrote one concerned commenter on an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/09/mit-media-lab-alterego-device-technology/\" target=\"_blank\">article about the technology</a>. &ldquo;Technology like this can be used by the real life Thought Police.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapur and the A.I. expert Maes are exquisitely sensitive to ethics concerns like these. Kapur believes that as a creator, he can subvert nefarious uses by building safeguards into the design. Kapur insists that AlterEgo can&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>actually</em>read your mind and will never be able to do so. He very deliberately developed it to only respond to&nbsp;<em>volitional</em>&nbsp;signalingâ€Š&mdash;â€Šconscious communication. You must&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to communicate with your computer brain in order to interact with it. That differentiates AlterEgo from, say, Google Glass. The device doesn&rsquo;t have a camera, for example, because Kapur doesn&rsquo;t want his wearables collecting any more information than you expressly give them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A.I. itself isn&rsquo;t bad, but we still have discussions about possible abuses of the technology,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So we try to build the tech to fit the principles that we developed. That&rsquo;s why we designed AlterEgo from the ground-upâ€Š&mdash;â€Šwe&rsquo;ve thought about it in a certain way from the beginning so that it will be used the way we designed it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', '2018-08-03 20:54:11', 'images/images2.jpg'),
